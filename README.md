AI-Powered Crypto Trading Bot - README
1. Project Overview

This repository contains the code for an AI-powered cryptocurrency trading bot built using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The bot is designed as a research platform for developing and testing advanced trading strategies, emphasizing flexibility in reward function design, data ingestion, and multi-agent experimentation.

2. Key Features

Dynamic Reward Function Framework: Enables easy iteration and testing of various reward strategies to optimize trading performance based on desired metrics (e.g., profit, Sharpe ratio, custom metrics).

Flexible Data Ingestion: Supports multiple data sources, including live market data from exchanges (e.g., Binance), historical data from CSV files, and synthetic data generation for comprehensive testing and development in diverse scenarios.

Modular Gym Environment: Built using OpenAI Gym, the trading environment is easily configurable to adapt to different trading scenarios, asset pairs, and data inputs, allowing for focused experimentation and research on specific market conditions or trading strategies.

Online Learning: The AI model utilizes online learning to continuously update its parameters as new data streams in, enabling adaptation to evolving market dynamics and real-time trading decisions based on the latest information.

Multi-Agent Framework: Facilitates comparative testing of multiple trading agents simultaneously, each with potentially different configurations (e.g., reward functions, model architectures, hyperparameters), allowing for robust evaluation and selection of the most effective strategies.

Experiment Tracking: Integrates with tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases to log experiments, track metrics, visualize performance, and compare different configurations and outcomes, streamlining the research and development process.

3. Getting Started
3.1 Prerequisites

Python 3.9+: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.

Poetry: We recommend using Poetry for dependency management. Install it using:

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Required Packages: Install project dependencies using Poetry:

poetry install
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Exchange API Keys (Optional): If using live market data, obtain API keys from your chosen exchange (e.g., Binance) and configure them securely in the config/secrets.env file.

3.2 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-trading-bot.git
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Navigate to the project directory:

cd crypto-trading-bot
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Activate the virtual environment:

poetry shell
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash
3.3 Configuration

config/: This directory contains YAML configuration files for various aspects of the bot, including data sources, model parameters, trading parameters, feature engineering settings, and more. Review and adjust these files as needed for your specific experiments.

secrets.env: This file (located in config/) stores sensitive information like API keys. Ensure it is properly configured and excluded from version control (add it to .gitignore).

3.4 Running the Bot

Training: To train a trading agent, use the scripts/run.py script with appropriate configurations. For example:

python scripts/run.py model=lstm reward_function=profit data_source=historical
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash

Backtesting: To backtest a trained agent on historical data, use the scripts/backtest.py script.

Hyperparameter Tuning: To optimize hyperparameters using Optuna, use the scripts/tune_hyperparameters.py script.
